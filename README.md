The project of this website dedicated to the world of video games encompassed both the front-end and the back-end. It allows users to explore an extensive library of video games, consoles, and genres, providing detailed information about each of them. Additionally, functionality was implemented for users to create private profiles where they can save their favorite games and customize their user experience. In the construction of the project, technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Flask, Python, SQL-Alchemy were employed, as well as external APIs to obtain relevant data, an internal database to store user and game information, and authentication tools like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for account security.
